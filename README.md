# Pump-Water-Job-Cayo-Perico
A small job I made out of boredom. You need to pump water on the island Cayo Perico, after that you can sell the water. But before that you need to repair the water pipe in order to pump water out of three water silos on the island.

Dependencys: ESX, mySQL-async

Compatible with ESX 1.2 (weight), although you can just change weight to limit for the compatible version ESX 1.1.

Please create the item "wasserflasche", into your database, in the table "items", or just change it in the code.

I don't know why, but this script is really a mess, could be written better, if I got the time, i'll do it.
